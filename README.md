Predictive Analytics using Python

Course Description: This is a course for graduate students who want to learn Python and Analytics in general and
Predictive Analytics in particular. Students will learn how to install and code in Python. You’ll use the state-of-the-art
Python modules such as pandas, numpy, sklearn, and tensorflow to collect and process business data (including
webscraping). You’ll then learn various predictive models in Python such as logistic regressions, decision trees, random
forests, naïve Bayes algorithms, support vector machine algorithms, kNN algorithms... You’ll use two real-world case
studies to practice the above models: predicting health insurance charges and predicting mortgage loan application
